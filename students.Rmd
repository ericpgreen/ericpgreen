# Mentoring

I mentor Duke undergraduates and graduate students, primarily those affiliated with the Global Health Institute. We have an [undergraduate major and minor in Global Health](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/education-and-training/undergraduate), and a [Master of Science of Global Health](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/education-and-training/graduate/master-of-science) degree program.

<b>Graduate Students</b>: Most years I take one or two new MSc in Global Health students. Our MSc program has a student-mentor matching process that begins soon after students arrive in the fall. Please contact me early if you have an interest in joining my group. Typically students that I mentor work directly with me and my colleagues on existing studies, either on the main research protocol or a highly related sub-study. I’m unlikely to take on a student who wants to collect original data for a completely independent study. Fieldwork is tough to organize, and I think it’s in the student’s best interest to stick with a plan that has a high probability of success. The goal is to leave the program on-time with at least one publication under your belt.

<b>Undergraduate Students</b>: I've mentored undergraduate students through several programs including the [Student Research Training](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/education-and-training/undergraduate/student-research-training-program), or SRT program, and [Bass Connections](http://globalhealth.duke.edu/education-and-training/bass-connections). I also work with undergraduate students through independent studies.
